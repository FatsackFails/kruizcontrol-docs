Kruiz Control enables a pseudo code approach to manage and automatically handle Twitch Channel Points, Twitch Chat, OBS or SLOBS, and StreamElements or Streamlabs alerts.

## Compatibility

Kruiz Control supports
- Twitch Channel Points
- Twitch Chat
- Twitch Hype Trains
- Streamlabs Alerts
- StreamElements Alerts
- OBS scene, source, and filter changes
- SLOBS scene and source changes
- Playing music (mp3, wav, ogg)
- Timers (triggering on an interval)
- Sending API calls

and more in [the documentation](/docs)!

The script should run on any broadcast software that supports browser sources, however only OBS and SLOBS support changing scenes and sources.

OBS.Live should also be supported but is untested.
