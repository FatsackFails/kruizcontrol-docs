## XSplit Support
The script should work with XSplit _BUT_ the OBS-like functionality will not work. XSplit does not provide a direct websocket interface to do such actions. It may be possible to implement a plugin that provides a websocket interface to connect with XSplit. If you know a way to achieve this, [please reach out](mailto:kruiser.twitch@gmail.com).

## Support for YouTube Alerts
I can definitely add support for YouTube alerts from Streamlabs. I just haven't had the time to implement it yet.

More investigation time is needed to implement YouTube with StreamElements.

## Support for YouTube Chat
Potentially if I can find the libraries to implement it. Again, if you know a way to achieve this, please reach out via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kruiser8) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/wU3ZK3Q).

## Will you support X
Please reach out if you have any ideas or other questions that were not covered in the documentation.
